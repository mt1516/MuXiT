Imagine the worlds of Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear & Vivian Stanshall colliding with the spirit of 50s rocknroll, whos just taken a crash course in musique-concrete and sound-art. This brings us somewhere close to where Oblivian Substanshall is leaping off from, lets complete the picture with words from the man himself...\n\"The so called pop and cutting-edge cultural approach I most definitely give a good straddling too. Indeed, it gives me a lot of freedom to exploit and play around with these idioms to my hearts content. And like you pointed out, its the fragments of these styles of expression which one can re-work, and try and achieve something fresh and amusing with, and hopefully interesting to listen to, or view. Its this looking back to move forward approach that I enjoy or, perhaps thats all there is anyway. Its nostalgic to some extent with a hint to the homage with an idiosyncratic slant. Some people may call this approach post-modern, but I see it as, yes, mixed up alright, and a little schizophrenic, but at the same time, entirely contemporary in its make over, boasting no actual and definite rules to hold you back... Its an elastic art form that can be stretched and stretched and so on... But in saying all that, I dont really like to analyse things too much, I think its better to just get on with it and play,play,play, happily immersing oneself within this contemporary landscape, and to be as creative and as inventive as one can possibly be within it.\"\nGreatest Hits Volume 1: If You Cant Help It",

        "description": "Its always been a pleasure making records with Edith, and her demos have been a big part of the pleasure. The process of imagining finished productions begins with playing Ediths original versions over and over again. The final versions are always a surprise, but as long as they retain something of the demos organic, spaced grace, we know that what weve got is pure Edith. Still, its often seemed a shame that we couldnt just put out the demos (and in the case of the song \"Calling Over Time,\" we just went ahead and did), so theres real satisfaction for me in listening to this collection. The songs here show that all Edith ever really needs is a guitar - with very little else, perhaps just another harmony vocal or two, she shines luminously.\nThe collection ends with a pair of cover tunes, unexplored but fertile territory in the Edith Frost discography. Country, blues and old-timey are all part of the foundation of her own musical blend, and hearing Edith sing these old songs is always transcendent, she always makes them her own. A record of all cover tunes has always seemed an appealing prospect - if it werent for the so many great original Frost songs to record. And some of the best of these can be found here - some in markedly different versions.",

        "description": "\"Drop Me Off In Denpasar\" started out as a bunch of piano exercises the artist wrote for himself to develop my finger independence for piano. The idea was to have each finger play a different rhythm separately as a drummers arms and legs do between kick, snare, cymbal, etc... \nAs he became more comfortable with them, he slowly started playing the patterns together and it became a piece of music rather than (hopefully) just \"finger-wanking.\"\nThe title references the capital of Bali, where he was soon to be leaving to study gamelan for the summer in Bali.\nMusicians on this (4-track) recording are, Ches Smith (drums), Dan Ake (homemade percussion), Pete Martin (piano and overdubbed gasang), and Bianca Austin (percussion and second piano on the intro).",

Fowlers project blends critical theory and musical practice, serving as both a critique and an extension of Mowitts ideas.\nThese tracks draw from diverse sources, such as historical boxing matches, classic rock and roll songs referenced in Mowitts book (e.g., by Chuck Berry, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles), and experimental sound manipulations (e.g., a telephonic exchange compressed into 10 seconds).

        "description": "Monotonix Live at the 2008 Record Fair\nWhat were we thinking unleashing two of the worlds most hazardous rock groups -- Tel Avivs Montonix and Tokyos DMBQ -- on the WFMU Record Fair this past Sunday? Well, we had both group sign declarations -- in blood -- assuring us that they would not set any fires. But they still nearly managed to bring the Record Fair to a grinding halt with their predictably unpredictable antics.\nMonotonix kicked off the whole mess with vocalist Ami Shale immediately dumping a full trashcan on the  drummers head. After scaling the walls of the Metropolitan Pavilion, Ami disappeared into the crowd. Soon he resurfaced on the other side of the room, ready to jump...\nAs the security staff strapped on their riot gear, Andy came to the rescue. He fought through the crowd and told Ami, \"This is not good behavior, brother. You cannot be up there, youre going to get this whole thing shut down\". This was a language that Ami understood, he did not want to be \"banded\" in America like he apparently has been in Israel and Canada. So he stepped down with grace even as the crowd continued to yell \"jump!\".",

There is the sound of the boys voice, the shovel digging the grave, and a fly buzzing nearby. In Part 2, there is an additional sound from a 3-scond sample of the guitar playing of Fred Frith.\nFor the most part, the recording is played back with little electronic alteration or \"processing.\" Rather, the music is made by breaking the original recording into very small events, and stringing these events into musical structures, creating shapes radically different from the original. To use a film analogy, it is as if the frames of a film were re-ordered so that the characters do altogether different actions. Or you might imagine the source sounds as physical objects viewed from different angles. I have placed you not only at different positions around the object, but have made windows of different sizes through which you look, and occasionally curved the galls into lenses of various types.\nThe choice of sound source comes from my experiences during the 1980s, most of which I spent working in or around El Salvador. During that time I saw a lot of death. And in that culture, which is both Catholic and highly politicized, death gets surrounded with all kinds of trappings that are intended to make it heroic and purposeful. Death is explained as Gods will, or as irrelevant since the dead \"live on in struggle.\"\nBut most of the 70,000 who died were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. They didnt want to die. There was no plan, no glory. Of course, there are many Salvadorans who did die heroically fighting a brutal regime against overwhelming odds. But even for the heroes, there is a starker, more immediate side to their death. Sooner or Later is about that side. There is a boy and his father is dead. And no angels sang and no one was better because of it and all that is left is this kid and the shovel digging the hole in the ground and the fly. If we want to find beauty here, we must find it in what is really there: the boy, the shovel, the fly. If we look closely, despite the unbearable sadness, we will discover it.\\",

        "description": "The tracks on Trail EP  by Colombian-born Japanese musician, Nobara Hayakawa, are a bundle of select experimental shoegaze electronica sketches recorded for different projects using computers, acoustic instruments and voice together they project a journey back in time into what every person on earth can feel as speaking of something deeply honest and real (including irony).\n\"Like old friends, my old selves singing about the lives Ive lived\", is how Nobara herself epitomizes the album. And indeed, taken together, the tracks sound like a chapter closing, like briefly looking back and remembering old and dear (and maybe less dear) things - things that make one wonder for a second, and then briefly smile, before one puts them away to get moving on...\nThe first track, Trail is \"about the love/hate pendular movements that one experiences under the effects of a caprice\". Hoover Love features a vacuum cleaner and is part of a project series for domestic machines and voices. Alas (wings) \"was made on a Sunday evening, in a state of deep sadness.\" The next track, Desalejar, has got no words at all, since the song is about trust. (Incidentally, desalejar  is the Spanish word for Martin Heideggers ent-fernung.) The longest track, Fuzzy Lady, is an improvisation for washing machine, drum machine, piano and voices. And the final track, Homelessness\"after reading too much Paul Auster and crying too much for the same ghost.\"\nTrail EP",

        "description": "Paper Navy is a folk-pop outfit originating on the fringes of Nashville, TN. With musical influences as divergent as classic country and 1970s era pop, you might imagine something like Bakersfield-Bread. Mmm...yes. Yet, in spite of a flavor that certainly ruminates, this doesnt quite sum up the paradoxically spare albeit lush sound of these guitar-based arrangements. Notwithstanding the occasional touch of telecaster-inspired twang and a few train-roll rhythms, the music on this debut release is more cosmic than country, calling on the subtle effects of atmosphere to soften an otherwise dark airing of views. From the sweetly seductive \"Honey Mead\" with its boozy swing to the Queen influenced pomp of \"Tongue Tied,\" Paper Navy aim to persuade a diverse audience that pop isnt so easily classified, and folk is more of an ethic than an aesthetic. This idea can also be heard on tunes like \"Swan Song,\" \"Factories,\" and the title track, \"All Grown Up,\" which delve into the existential misgivings of Everyman while remaining pleasantly listenable and catchy enough to hold on to. This project was recorded in a ramshackle rehearsal space (that also serves as a laundry room) by Shawn Anfinson (vocals, acoustic guitar), Brandon Harris (guitars, bass) and Simon Lynn (drums, bells). They are now joined by Jim Elrod (bass), and Jeff Weems (keys).\nAll Grown Up",

The pure genius and musicianship of the artist reaches out of every tune to wave a big smiling hello to every single listener.What else needs to be said? Nothing really; the music more than speaks for itself. This EP represents the first five tracks of what is actually adcBicycles debut album, which will be released on Noise Factory Records in the coming weeks. We are certain that after listening through this first part of the album, youll be dying for more.\nEP",

Evidently he made too many concessions for the ballet producers and didnt feel it was true to his original concepts and nowhere near as good as his last ballet score, THE SLEEPING BEAUTY.Isnt that remarkable when so many movements from the composition are instantly recognizable classical masterpieces?Now, lets say that more than 100 years later we give his score a Tim Burton - Danny Elfman - PDQ Bach treatment. Not talking HOOKED ON CLASSICS here; instead, reworking the whole composition and giving it some bounce, bleeps, bloops, and even more music box charm*. This is exactly what Lanark, our friend in Argentina, has done. One cant help but wonder what the old boy Tchaikovsky would think of this reworking.Lanark has a passion and a gift for reworking classical pieces. This is one of his earliest, if not the first, releases of his deconstruction and reconstruction of classical works. It is especially fun in winter when we are most likely to hear THE NUTCRACKER SUITE.Heres hoping this charming little electronic music box from Lanark brings you joy this season and all year.* The original score got its music box charm from the celesta (pronounced chelesta, ch as in cello), an idiophone that strikes metal rods via a keyboard. It is one of the most wonderfully otherworldly sounding instruments ever created. In fact, the name of this 1886 invention is derived from its \"celestial\" sound.Heres a great audio piece on the celesta from NPR.source of review: Blogio Oddio\nMy Russian Bride",

        "description": "Did you know that Tchaikovsky didnt like the score he composed for THE NUTCRACKER ballet? Yeah, for starters, he didnt even want the job. Evidently he made too many concessions for the ballet producers and didnt feel it was true to his original concepts and nowhere near as good as his last ballet score, THE SLEEPING BEAUTY.Isnt that remarkable when so many movements from the composition are instantly recognizable classical masterpieces?Now, lets say that more than 100 years later we give his score a Tim Burton - Danny Elfman - PDQ Bach treatment. Not talking HOOKED ON CLASSICS here; instead, reworking the whole composition and giving it some bounce, bleeps, bloops, and even more music box charm*. This is exactly what Lanark, our friend in Argentina, has done. One cant help but wonder what the old boy Tchaikovsky would think of this reworking.Lanark has a passion and a gift for reworking classical pieces. This is one of his earliest, if not the first, releases of his deconstruction and reconstruction of classical works. It is especially fun in winter when we are most likely to hear THE NUTCRACKER SUITE.Heres hoping this charming little electronic music box from Lanark brings you joy this season and all year.* The original score got its music box charm from the celesta (pronounced chelesta, ch as in cello), an idiophone that strikes metal rods via a keyboard. It is one of the most wonderfully otherworldly sounding instruments ever created. In fact, the name of this 1886 invention is derived from its \"celestial\" sound.Heres a great audio piece on the celesta from NPR.source of review: Blogio Oddio\nMy Russian Bride",

Heard It Records as an \"old mans music for young people\".\nCreated, among other things, with his Roland SH-101 found in a Monaco trashcan, his TB-303 and various synthesized voices, Vicnet gives us a viscerally electro album, with mixed influences and memories evoking Egyptian Lover under MDMA.

Then the other person has to draw the body, fold that as well and so on. My friend Pierlo in Rome and I always wanted to make music together, and we were looking for a good way to bridge the distance without losing the fun. So we tried to copy the principal of the folding game onto our music, creating a technique we like to call primixing, which is different from just remixing. One person prepares the rough base for a song, leaving it open what musical direction to follow. The other person remixes that base and adds new elements, then returns it. This can go back and forth until the song seems complete. Unlike making music on your own, you have to keep in mind that what you compose is to be left open and accessable.

He has several releases at Breakin Bread, one of the best English labels. Caruanas works were born in freestyle we also prefer. So it is not surprising to find a rich variety in his repertoir: dubstep (Cause for celebration), hip hop (Tea of sea), break-hop (Keeping it me), funky break (Get it off your chest), dub (Never seen before) and funny-sampling tracks. Even though he usually composes short tracks, it could probably be the secret of his successbrief tracks one after the other, giving an especially exciting movement of so many style\nWelcome Aboard",

Too much time on your hands can be hazardous for the mental health, and after the first month we were all courting madness, behaving quite erratically.Thankfully, we were equipped with weapons to stave of the slow approach of insanity. There were cellos, saxophones, guitars, moog synthesizers, bizarre eastern instruments, turntables, xylophones, mandolins, dulcimers, violins, keyboards, hand drums, microphones and all sorts of other musical devices of mayhem; a veritable arsenal of sonic destruction.We recorded songs like sick animals possessed by some dark muse from the far reaches of space.We averaged a song a day, and came out of the winter with more than one hundred songs recorded, and about three times as many freestyle jams recorded.There was nothing else to do, no way to measure the days, except for the relentless flow of songs that poured out from us.For some weeks we would just do blues songs, othersed by reggae, sometimes we would just spend days creating atonal noise collages.Creative process was the only thing that added any meaning to life in the cabin, so we created.This collection represents some of our best tracks, and were hand picked to showcase the diversity of styles that we were juggling.Its only the smallest of drops in the bucket.We all met at tree planting camp, a creamshow in the rugged heights of the Malakwa Valley in Southern BC.It was some of the most dangerous land that any of us had ever seen, but the money was great.After sensing a chemistry with eachother, we decided to hit an open mic jam at a local biker bar.The results were fantastic.People from all walks of life praised us, and thats what led us to form a band.Unfortunately, the strain of being in a cabin together for so long strained the experience, and the band disbanded over the next tree planting season.There may be more inp>\nthe golden years",

Is it pro-, anti\nreligious or neither? It is listeners job to make conclusions. La\nmusique s style ranges from dark ambient to drone and noise.Tracks 1\nand 3 contain a lot of church acoustics, choir loops, organ sounds,\nnoises etc. Track 2 features church bells, orthodox chanting and\nelectronic noises. Track 4 features only sounds from Finnish span cl\"yshortcuts\">christian radio sermons, all words have been edited out leaving only breath-ins and -outs, room acoustics etc. Last two tracks are built on span class=\"yshortcuts\">construction site\nsounds spiced with interference noises and field recording snippets\nfrom various sources. Last track is a massive 30-minute journey into\nsound, certainly not suitable for people who want their music/noise as\nfast-food-like short sharp blasts\nLa Musique Concr te pa",

A softer male voice reads the same a little delayed. There are big noises, a tram, and another. Some radios and more fireworks and finally a park with birds, talking and a radio playing something Middle Eastern. In a large space someone gives a talk, almost understandable, as buckets clatter and things scrape in the distance. The woman again, saying existence and aesthetic meaningfully, a piano plays quite extensively. Moving in another large space, a woman speaks German, there is chittering, banging, distant singing and tapping on the mike. And finally a man talking about senses, everything we are surrounded by caring for us, society and music taking us to the gates of hell, as traffic pasess.\"/i>\n-\nKulissen Abriss",

You are about to hear and view material that was released by Kapotte Muziek in 1988. It was an anthology of works from the first three and half years of existence. A lifetime it seemed back then, a mere drop in time when I look back on it now. I compiled this tape in 1988 for the US branche of my label Korm Plastics, run by Jeff Surak, who was the driving force behind Destruktive Technologies Foundation.I went back to the archives of Kapotte Muziek and dug out some of the original artwork produced for some of these tracks. In those days your compilation cassette was not complete with a black and white xeroxed booklet. I either had some drawing or some text or some image. I also produced some postcards and in my na ve youth I used skulls and pictures of naked women: things I wouldnt do now, or in a more thought-out context at least. Youll find these postcards and flyers in the mixed media part of the CD. The original cassette came with a booklet and I use the same linernotes here, but some sl alternation here and there. Here it goes... This anthology from Kapotte Muziek is covering up the first period of the existence of this group. Group? In the first years the group existed out of two people, whilst now there is only one, or better: we are all Kapotte Muziek. Kapotte Muziek started as the invention of Christian Nijs and Frans de Waard. The reason was not at all the urge to start a band but the necessity of making a track for a compilation done by Frans de Waard (being Katacombe Vol.3). After this track we decided to do some more, because Christian had a guitar, tapedeck and during a journey by train he had found a violin bow. This shows already we didnt had many instruments, never will have. We could always borrow things from friends. \"\nAn Apology is Necessary",

Based on Jacques Derridas \"Difference\" notion. Jacques Derrida begins the essay \"Diff r\" (perhaps the most systematic articulation of the non-concept that, according to Derrida, he \"has been able to utilize\" in previous works) by talking about the letter a and trying to explain (though not justify; instead perform an \"insistent intensification of its play\") the neologism that he developed. In the first few paragraphs of the essay, he talks about writing and how the neologism (\"neographism\" he calls it) is \"a lapse in the discipline and law\" of that system, a sort of distruption in writing and, if I may add, in language and the order of signs in general.Sados \"LA DIFFERANZA\" follows this scheme, nothing more, nothing less.With Paolo Baltaro, Sandro Marinoni, Diego Marzi, Gianni Opezzo and Boris Savoldelli.Youll not find this record anywhere else, it is not for sale on shops or web mailorders. Its free!Please check www.societaanonimadecostruzionismiorganici.com for further and newer releases, and more to come.\nLa Differanza",

        "description": "The Farthest South is a term coined by the explorers of the early 20th century which describes\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">the southernmost point one can reach. Over the years, the Farthest South was the goal of the\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">bravest and most courageous. Sir Shackleton with his team from Britain and the Norwegian\nAmundsen are but two of the famous adventurers who attempted to find the span class=\"GRcorrect\">Farthest South.\n \nThe most important significance of the term is that it doesnt speak of a static place, but rather\nspan cl\"GRcorrect\">a point of ever shifting location. Every time someone manages to go farther, thats where the\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">new Farthest South is. This is the idea that lies at the core of the band as a musical entity.\n \nFarthest South is an Israeli group which was created for the purpose of journeying to the\nspan cl\"GRcorrect\">individual and collective Farthest South of its members, which banded together with the\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">common goal of searching for that ever-elusive place where giving voice to their unspoken\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">streams of consciousness span class=\"GRcorrect\">is possible.\n \nBarry Berko (35) has been playing for years in improvisational groups and is a student at\nspan cl\"GRcorrect\">the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. Yair Etziony (37) is one of the pioneers of the\nIsraeli Glitch scene and the owner of the False Industries record label. Yair Yona (32) is the\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">former general manager and artistic director of Anova Records, a solo artist and span class=\"GRcorrect\">bass player in\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">several bands.\n \nIn May 2012 the group entered the studio in order to record the singular collective language\nspan cl\"GRcorrect\">which was to be created that day. During the day, various guest musicians joined the band\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">as co-explorers in their own right. Omens & Talismans is the documentation of their session\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">with Saxophone player, composer and master of improvisation Albert Beger.\n \nFor the band, it was the first time they were joined by a musician who brought elements of\nJazz into the room, and for Begerthe first time playing with an electric/electronic s\"GRnoSuggestion GRcorrect\">improv\nspan class=\"GRcorrect\">group.\n \nSo as to not get carried away with definitions, suffice it to say that the result is honest,\nspan cl\"GRcorrect\">sincere, intense and direct.\n \nThe album is available for listening and purchase (via digital download) on the bands\nspan cl\"GRnoSuggestion GRcorrect\">Bandcamp page and in all other digital stores and streaming services.\nCDs will be sold at gigs and via the bands website.\nOmens & Talismans",

At this stage of their development, MiH had already had two of their tracks (Le Quark & Mumbo Jingo) played on BBC Radio 1s Introducing show, and had gained an ever increasing enthusiastic following plus support from various bloggers, journalists, DJs, and other musicians.After taking time away from gigging to work on a new live set, and having recruited Robbi Pinkerton (How Garbo Died, Julian The Apostate) and Davey Gwynne (Blood Blood, Adult Emergency) into the band, MiH agreed to release with BLM, and are currently lining up numerous gigs for 2013 and planning to release their debut album in March, then tour the continent in summer.a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/machinesinheaven\">LIKE MACHINES IN HEAVEN a href=\"http://twitter.com/machinesheaven\">atMACHINESHEAVEN Use hasthtag: #GLASGOWJIHADEP\nThe Glasgow Jihad EP",

At this stage of their development, MiH had already had two of their tracks (Le Quark & Mumbo Jingo) played on BBC Radio 1s Introducing show, and had gained an ever increasing enthusiastic following plus support from various bloggers, journalists, DJs, and other musicians.After taking time away from gigging to work on a new live set, and having recruited Robbi Pinkerton (How Garbo Died, Julian The Apostate) and Davey Gwynne (Blood Blood, Adult Emergency) into the band, MiH agreed to release with BLM, and are currently lining up numerous gigs for 2013 and planning to release their debut album in March, then tour the continent in summer.a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/machinesinheaven\">LIKE MACHINES IN HEAVEN a href=\"http://twitter.com/machinesheaven\">atMACHINESHEAVEN Use hasthtag: #GLASGOWJIHADEP\nThe Glasgow Jihad EP",

These names you should definitely remember.\nN.E.W. is a platform and network for producers in Gelderland and Overijssel.

In their music you can hear the influence of everything that is happening in electronic music at the moment. The dominance of the four to the floor time is long past, and influences are drawn from ambient, acid, dubstep, future garage, glitch, juke, and trap.\nSam a la Bamalot and Kalima (formerly known as Radion) are represented with a track for the third consecutive year.

A professional jury made a choice from over a hundred entries to come to this selection of twelve tracks. The jury included amongst others other Erik Delobel, programmer of Hedon in Zwolle, and Harco Rutgers, owner of the record label Esc.rec.\nThis draft of producers will be promoted by NEW all year long in many different ways. First of all theres the release of the compilation album NEW 8.0. Free digital copies are available through nieuweelectronischewaar.nl and record label Esc.rec. takes care of the online distribution.

Milos Afternoon Snack\"Sonic version of Matt Maddens Oubapo\"I really wasnt sure what to do for the Junto assignment this week... after a lot of thinking and looking up Matt Madden, I saw a photo on his blog, reading and sipping a martini.

I quite like the melody here, and will probably use it again in the future with a longer (and more flushed out) piece. And its 99 seconds, with a special appearance by naotkos \"Abstractedly\".

I recorded repetitive rhythmic bursts of noise off the radio, edited them so had accents (follow by fades) and then mixed in distorted and manipulated versions of the recorded music sample.As per instructions, it begins with at least 5 seconds of the untouched field recording, and 5 seconds of the untouched sample at the end.The best way to describe the result is a bizarre soundscape of a shortwave radio being sacrificed to a volcano.

I didnt know Aaron, but I make use of his work with both RSS feeds and archive.org on a daily basis (my version of \"local news\"), not to mention my support for SOPA and his dedication to keeping the internet a free and open place.After reading a few articles on it, I found Lawrence Lessigs was the most powerful and insightful: http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bullyI read it a few times in my head and then composed this piece on Ableton. a href=\"http://disquiet.com/2013/01/17/disquiet0055-twoscrews/\" target=\"_blank\">10.

Despite that, I had a go anyway - this is the result of two attempts.The first was running \"Re\" through my monotron and the second was isolating sections I liked from \"Do\" and stretched them with Adobe and then looped.

I had initally chosen the same section as BASSLINGss did (Thriller [disquiet0066-nonofi] by BASSLINGss), so I downloaded his track and I played along to him, playing along with Jeffrey, essentially making it a trio. This works better for me, as I find drums sound a little empty without some bass in there.As the rhythm was pretty much established on Jeffreys original track, I ended playing inside the beats and wound up with something I believe mortals refer to as \"overplaying\".But it was fun to do, and I figured thats what the project was all about: celebrating Jeffreys memory and enjoying doing it. Ive uploaded it as a .wav in the event that anyone wants to make this a quartet.This track is a posthumous collaboration with Jeffrey Melton, aka Nofi, who passed away on March 30, 2013.

This works better for me, as I find drums sound a little empty without some bass in there.As the rhythm was pretty much established on Jeffreys original track, I ended playing inside the beats and wound up with something I believe mortals refer to as \"overplaying\".But it was fun to do, and I figured thats what the project was all about: celebrating Jeffreys memory and enjoying doing it.

This works better for me, as I find drums sound a little empty without some bass in there.As the rhythm was pretty much established on Jeffreys original track, I ended playing inside the beats and wound up with something I believe mortals refer to as \"overplaying\".But it was fun to do, and I figured thats what the project was all about: celebrating Jeffreys memory and enjoying doing it.

Sacrificial Shortwave\"Transition between field and composed\"Inspired by Marcs \"The Classical Button\" radio recording last week, I used a field recording of static from my shortwave radio, and combined it with the track by Tag Cloud. I noticed that when \"A Controlled Burn\" was reversed, it is a tiny gong being played at various tempos and intensities. I recorded repetitive rhythmic bursts of noise off the radio, edited them so had accents (follow by fades) and then mixed in distorted and manipulated versions of the recorded music sample.As per instructions, it begins with at least 5 seconds of the untouched field recording, and 5 seconds of the untouched sample at the end.The best way to describe the result is a bizarre soundscape of a shortwave radio being sacrificed to a volcano.

Sacrificial Shortwave\"Transition between field and composed\"Inspired by Marcs \"The Classical Button\" radio recording last week, I used a field recording of static from my shortwave radio, and combined it with the track by Tag Cloud. I noticed that when \"A Controlled Burn\" was reversed, it is a tiny gong being played at various tempos and intensities. I recorded repetitive rhythmic bursts of noise off the radio, edited them so had accents (follow by fades) and then mixed in distorted and manipulated versions of the recorded music sample.As per instructions, it begins with at least 5 seconds of the untouched field recording, and 5 seconds of the untouched sample at the end.The best way to describe the result is a bizarre soundscape of a shortwave radio being sacrificed to a volcano.

I didnt know Aaron, but I make use of his work with both RSS feeds and archive.org on a daily basis (my version of \"local news\"), not to mention my support for SOPA and his dedication to keeping the internet a free and open place.After reading a few articles on it, I found Lawrence Lessigs was the most powerful and insightful: http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bullyI read it a few times in my head and then composed this piece on Ableton. a href=\"http://disquiet.com/2013/01/17/disquiet0055-twoscrews/\" target=\"_blank\">10.

Despite that, I had a go anyway - this is the result of two attempts.The first was running \"Re\" through my monotron and the second was isolating sections I liked from \"Do\" and stretched them with Adobe and then looped.

Its one half covers of peeinmyfacewithsurgery and one half brand new original PIMFWS discharge. Urine Cakes cd-r is a dark and undead fantasy-for-a-laugh until the invitation requires a more specific and profitable open ended disaster. Listen up! It has nothing to do with the expectations implied by covers in fact there seems to be absolutely nothing going on but alien despair harsh voice chocolate milk snot from shortwave radio field recordings and breakcore spit back within the humble abstraction of pure imitation. We ask you to come with us on our bad trip by becoming peeinmyfacewithsurgery for just one glimpse into the chunk of a wave returning to effervescent incongruity. Our invitation to imitation requires a nest of swollen carpenter ants popping in the sunshine and the appearance of moonshine expired. The huff-puff drinking dreary beginnings are running through an invocation of sound chunks placed in random orbit, in response to a dry wind; ever ample and justified in retaliation to imitation. Dropping on toes and ears like ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag!\"\n\"Im chuffed as hell to revisit this release after 6 years of moldering! So what follows is some special information about this lost turd-in-a-punchbowl. And remember it alternates between stuff made by our friends and bona fide PIMFWS.\nThis is a run down of invited guests and their expectorations:\nTrack 1Wayne McCann & Erick Mitsak 222 - Well guess what, i dont really even know who these dudes are and Jaime says, I cant recall who Wayne is, maybe hes Ericks alter ego, but I met Erick in Melbourne, hes a weirdo movie actor and monologuer. My guess is that these fuckers work for Mi5 & Mossad and somehow infiltrated our cd by drilling a head in Luca 8mms skull while he was sleeping in order to insert the sounds onto the master tape.\nPee In My Face With Surgery is Jaime Fennelly (electronics & voice) and Fritz Welch (voice & percussion). This material was recorded by Uptown Willis in the basement of S. S. Willoughby in Bushwick Brooklyn on September 11, 2007.\"\nUrine Cakes",

He also makes videos and sound works and has been know to hold large groups of art fans hostage inside galleries and churches. This piece was recorded in HackneyWick East London and we were based in Bushwick Brooklyn which is possibly why he called it 2 Wick to You. It sounds like Telly Tubby acid revenge extrus a fag.\nTrack 11Naval Cassidy Pea Surgery - There is no radio signal safe from the transcendental wiggling of Naval Cassidy! In his normal life he is a prime practitioner of live video performance. In these situations he simultaneously manipulates small objects or props while capturing the activity on a series of miniature surveillance cameras then projecting the image overhead. These signals are switched by hand and by utilizing MaxMSP with soundtracks culled from fragments of his favorite records. He is a killer manipulator of sampled sound and shortwave radio broadcasts and sometimes wears a Batman yarmulke.\nPee In My Face With Surgery is Jaime Fennelly (electronics & voice) and Fritz Welch (voice & percussion).

We recorded it when were on one of the final Peeesseye tours of the USSA. We had a fantastically fucked up gig at Std M Theftable. We all (except Skot) stayed up late drinking whiskey and listening to Forsyth and Cranky twiddling Grateful Dead leads and woke up early to get back on the road. After breakfast we went to the seaside and recorded this ditty which by the way is one of the most significant songs ever written by Nerd Rock pioneers Three Day Stubble.

Its quite different from his last release on Happy Puppy - for lack of a better description, its experimental but still very accessible. It was only until I quizzed Dave about what I was hearing did he give me some background on how the songs were composed. I dont want to give away any secrets (you can ask him if you want) but rather you just listen and enjoy the unpredictable pretty nature of the music, which seems to zig-zag, but with a strict sense of purpose.

There are a few pieces on here that are also in the \"Recursive Artifacts Collection\", but the collection is an ongoing repository for cool improvisations as they come to me, whereas, this \"album\" is a done deal ans is sequenced in such a way as to enhance your ability to listen to it as a whole. \nThis is the dedication i included in the handmade cd packaging; \nThis Project is Dedicated to My Mother, Syble Lucille Lockridge (1943-2007). \nMy Life of Travel and music always terrified and excited my mother in equal measure. Id like to think she would have felt the same way about this Disc. I love you and miss you Mamma... \nAfter the death of my mother in 2007 I was lost. The reality that we only have a very short time here in this form was hanging, rain cloud-like, over everything. I really did not know what to do next. or why. But then I remembered how my mother would love my inconsequential stories of life playing on the streets of san francisco or touring with Soul II Soul. she was always so afraid that something could happen to me in the midst of flinging myself around the world on a whim, but would instantly relax when i would call home to tell of som enabled by music. eventually, she came to revel in my adventures with me. Before she passed, she told me that she really loved that I live my life on my own terms. that i didnt let fear keep me in a life i didnt want. But after her death i felt like i had lost my compass. Why was i doing what i was doing, really? \nI came to realize that much of my artistic life for a few years had actually been overrun by fears; fear of doing my own thing...fear of not really knowing w\"my own thing\" was, or if I or anyone else would even like it if i did. I was afraid of not knowing I wanted to do, artistically. It was a lot to think about while helping my family rebuild our collective lives in the aftermath of her passing. \n \nIn her memory I decided that I wanted to be the person she thought I was; fearless. I knew at that moment that I wanted to truly follow my own path...to create my own music my own way. I decided at that moment to perform all live all the time using a technique\"Live-looping\", which is process of recording a repeating loop of a musician playing or singing, then layering themselves playing or sing another part, and on and on, until you have a full song playing. the technique has been around for decades. But along the way, I developed my own techniques which I call Beatjazz. \nBecause I have performed with DJs for years, playing just about any type of instrument sound, including drums, along with the DJ set, I found that i could not only play everything, but I knew how to do it in the aesthetic of a sort of live, constantly evolving DJ set. so as I got better at this technique, I again started thinking about why I was doing this instead of something else. the answer; because I wanted to. And I am no longer afraid to admit that. \nThis album is a testament to that. The Nomadic Diary of Onyx Ashanti; Recursive Artifacts vol.1 is a collection of recordings taken during various Live performances from 2007-2009. Each is purely improvised, meaning that I had no ideaof time, of what i was going to play when i played them. if you notice while listening to the CD, the pieces start with a particular type of sound and everything comes in, layer by layer, and is deconstructed and reconstructed in mutated forms. as pieces are built and destroyed, new sounds take their place. new directions are explored. truly exciting developments birth themselves from the always simple origins of a single, naked looped recording of a sound being played to the rhythm of life. And like life itself, the pieces are born, explore this existence in all of its wonder, and eventually return to nothing. \nThank you for listening and reading. There is more about Beatjazz on the CD-ROM portion of the Disc. Just click CLICK HERE. Live and love life... \nThe Nomadic Diary of Onyx Ashanti: Recursive Artifacts vol. 1",

Why was i doing what i was doing, really? \nI came to realize that much of my artistic life for a few years had actually been overrun by fears; fear of doing my own thing...fear of not really knowing w\"my own thing\" was, or if I or anyone else would even like it if i did. I was afraid of not knowing I wanted to do, artistically. It was a lot to think about while helping my family rebuild our collective lives in the aftermath of her passing. \n \nIn her memory I decided that I wanted to be the person she thought I was; fearless. I knew at that moment that I wanted to truly follow my own path...to create my own music my own way. I decided at that moment to perform all live all the time using a technique\"Live-looping\", which is process of recording a repeating loop of a musician playing or singing, then layering themselves playing or sing another part, and on and on, until you have a full song playing. the technique has been around for decades. But along the way, I developed my own techniques which I call Beatjazz. \nBecause I have performed with DJs for years, playing just about any type of instrument sound, including drums, along with the DJ set, I found that i could not only play everything, but I knew how to do it in the aesthetic of a sort of live, constantly evolving DJ set. so as I got better at this technique, I again started thinking about why I was doing this instead of something else. the answer; because I wanted to. And I am no longer afraid to admit that. \nThis album is a testament to that. The Nomadic Diary of Onyx Ashanti; Recursive Artifacts vol.1 is a collection of recordings taken during various Live performances from 2007-2009. Each is purely improvised, meaning that I had no ideaof time, of what i was going to play when i played them. if you notice while listening to the CD, the pieces start with a particular type of sound and everything comes in, layer by layer, and is deconstructed and reconstructed in mutated forms. as pieces are built and destroyed, new sounds take their place. new directions are explored. truly exciting developments birth themselves from the always simple origins of a single, naked looped recording of a sound being played to the rhythm of life. And like life itself, the pieces are born, explore this existence in all of its wonder, and eventually return to nothing. \nThank you for listening and reading. There is more about Beatjazz on the CD-ROM portion of the Disc. Just click CLICK HERE. Live and love life... \nThe Nomadic Diary of Onyx Ashanti: Recursive Artifacts vol. 1",

        "description": "This is the download of the CD i sold as i busked around Europe during the summer of 2009. it is a collection of Recursive improvisations that i collected over the course of the last 2 years. There are a few pieces on here that are also in the \"Recursive Artifacts Collection\", but the collection is an ongoing repository for cool improvisations as they come to me, whereas, this \"album\" is a done deal ans is sequenced in such a way as to enhance your ability to listen to it as a whole. \nThis is the dedication i included in the handmade cd packaging; \nThis Project is Dedicated to My Mother, Syble Lucille Lockridge (1943-2007). \nMy Life of Travel and music always terrified and excited my mother in equal measure. Id like to think she would have felt the same way about this Disc. I love you and miss you Mamma... \nAfter the death of my mother in 2007 I was lost. The reality that we only have a very short time here in this form was hanging, rain cloud-like, over everything. I really did not know what to do next. or why. But then I remembered how my mother would love my inconsequential stories of life playing on the streets of san francisco or touring with Soul II Soul. she was always so afraid that something could happen to me in the midst of flinging myself around the world on a whim, but would instantly relax when i would call home to tell of som enabled by music. eventually, she came to revel in my adventures with me.

        "description": "suRRism-Phonoethics is proud to release this double set of Stormhat!\nThese pieces are all structured around field recordings from very different locations/spaces. The field recordings are being manipulated in quite a bit rudeness. Some of the original recorded sounds are being made by me as I in admittedly rather rudimentary ways make sounds from objects or record the dirty sounds of rustling, dripping, clanging or blowing. To these sounds are added a little filtering and discrete effects. Im not interested in field recording per se but in the gritty sound world of the tactile world reconstructed in my imagination. I experience a trancelike stasis in these pieces which I enjoy and find exhilarating.\nStormhat is the artist/composer eter Bach Nicolaisen from Jutland in Denmark.He is teaching art at a art-architecture-design school and living there as well.Stormhat enjoys cats, his garden, the weather, his family, consciousness, experimental pleasures, art, literature, sound.\nDon ask yammered; one between one at this hail undress - why lesser, known the describe the more!\n- AndrPissoir\nField and Track",

Their split 7\" with Dutchguts (an homage to Townes Van Zandt), and crafty one-sided LP, singlehandedly prove that grindcore is not only alive and well in NJ, but pushing the boundaries way beyond the sometimes lunkheaded conventions of that genre (unreadable logos, oppressively lurid lyrical content, and excessively complex riffing and arrangements.)\nLike Psychic Limb who rode us out of our original weekly tenure on WFMUs air (not at all in sound, but in mighty PURPOSE), Ubasute (pronounced ooo-ba-soo-tay), are a welcome cut above, their modesty and strength ensured that they would be one of the first bands, THE first in fact, to mark My Castle of Quiets return to live, real-time radio sessions. Fronted by vocalist Alex Caprio, whose Mountain Mover solo-noise tape made a big spash on MCoQ last year, Ubasute are quite simply NOT TO BE MISSED.\nFor more info, check out the a href=\"https://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/54320\" target=\"_blank\">playlist.\nWm.

Most of the tracks are brandnew, worked out of sketches since 2008, and I added some older pieces like \"SlowDrive\" remixed with new sounds or featuring singer and cellist Magda Glocka from Poland, who was inspired by the music and sent me her voice-tracks for \"Play all Day\" and \"Melting Point\". All work including mix and master is done on a Notebook. The only analogue instrument I recorded is my electric guitar. The melodic rest is native software I played on masterkeyboards, and the drumming is a mix of programming on drum-machines and sample-cuts. 2014 I added some tracks shown only here that didn t make it to the album for my choice at 2\"\nFrom: a title=\"http://www.acustronica.com/albums/77-slow-drive.html\" href=\"http://www.acustronica.com/albums/77-slow-drive.html\" target=\"_self\">http://www.acustronica.com/albums/77-slow-drive.html\nSlowDrive",

Our individuality growing more obsolete with each passing year is presented as a fundamental change to the human condition in some cases where we are simply nothing more than numerical constructs to the government and major corporations who are taking over our lives more and more each day.Though the concept in this recording is just demonstrated in one area, it is still a universal outcry of the people of a nation whose government is doing more than simply overseeing the individuals they are supposed to represent.The ever-growing body of officials are not satisfied with merely leading, they want to control every aspect of every individual life and create a \"we\" and do away with the \"I\".This then, is my personal protest against the radical elimination of personal freedom and dignity for each individual and it is my hope, that after hearing this music, you, the listener, if youve felt a sense of your personal freedom lost in whatever aspect of your life is important, that you will be able to take small steps, which can lead to giant leaps to regain that which has been eroded over the years by governing bodies who believe that we are not individuals, but simply parts of a giant collective.My most heartfelt thanks goes out to my good friend Shannah Kueffler who was of invaluable assistance in answering all my medical questions as well as making sure that all effects were as true to nature as they could be for the project. I would also like to give thanks to Rebekkah Hilgraves for providing an outstanding reading of the monologue on the introductory track.

We wanted to expand our family! The most important thing is that weve shown there are a lot of talented people in the region, with completely different views of the world. We have also made many collaborations and new friendships. Another goal was to blend together 2 alternative currents that are often divided: bands (live) and electronic (producers), because we believe music knows no limits or boundaries and for a smart man, even mosquito is music. We managed to gather around artists from all over ex-Yugoslavia! As far as genres are concerned, the compilation is very diverse. Most of the songs are exclusively made for this compilation, and none of them were previously published. We give you this compilation for free, and in return you can share it with your friends. :).

The project, Experimental Israel, will include a weekly broadcast with musicians or artists related to the experimental scene in Israel. Through interviews and new commissions from the featured artists we will attempt to trace the outlines of the experimental scene at large, and ask whether there is a style that could be regarded as Israeli experimentalism.\nAlthough the series will not necessarily attempt to answer the main questions, it will create an ongoing narrative leading us through the main focal points of the Israeli scene. In effect, the series will serve as a snapshot in time allowing a more knowing and aware conversation on a topic that until now has been almost completely neglected.\nWeekly sessions with featured artists will take place in Halas Radios studio at the Israeli Centre for Digital Art in Holon and will be broadcast live on www.halas.am. Occasionally the project will host a live broadcast featuring an unlikely pairing of artists on one stage. This laboratory-like concert will aid us in shedding even more light on a scene still discovering its borders.",

The project, Experimental Israel, will include a weekly broadcast with musicians or artists related to the experimental scene in Israel. Through interviews and new commissions from the featured artists we will attempt to trace the outlines of the experimental scene at large, and ask whether there is a style that could be regarded as Israeli experimentalism.\nAlthough the series will not necessarily attempt to answer the main questions, it will create an ongoing narrative leading us through the main focal points of the Israeli scene. In effect, the series will serve as a snapshot in time allowing a more knowing and aware conversation on a topic that until now has been almost completely neglected.\nWeekly sessions with featured artists will take place in Halas Radios studio at the Israeli Centre for Digital Art in Holon and will be broadcast live on www.halas.am. Occasionally the project will host a live broadcast featuring an unlikely pairing of artists on one stage. This laboratory-like concert will aid us in shedding even more light on a scene still discovering its borders.",
