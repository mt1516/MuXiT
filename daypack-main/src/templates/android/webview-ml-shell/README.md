# WebView Shell

This is the absolute barebones WebView that we're creating for this project.  The purpose of this webview is to:

* Run Gradio Applications from Hugging Face
* Expose OnDevice Machine Learning Frameworks to Javascript so they can be called from the Gradio UI
* Be able to be deployed from Python directly from a Jupyter Notebook

This is a tiny demo of what's possible where hybrid application development meets Machine Learning Development, and this is meant to be
a part of a larger prototyping tool that is yet to be named.
